############### Getting started ############
### 1. LOAD/INSTALL LIBRARIES 

library(topicmodels)
library(ggwordcloud)
library(tidytext)
library(textdata)
library(tidyverse)


### 2.LOAD AND PROCESS DATA  ######

#create shorter way to refer to the song for plotting purposes
taylor_swift_lyrics <- taylor_swift_lyrics %>% 
    mutate(song = word(Title, 1,2))

### 3. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXAMPLE USING BING DICTIONARY ###########

# generate data frame with sentiment derived from the Bing dictionary
(ts_bing <- ts_words %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")))

# using the Bing dictionary:
# visualize the most frequent positive/negative words in the all series and for each album
# see reorder_within() and scale_x_reordered(): https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/

## for all albums
ts_bing %>%
  # generate frequency count for each word and sentiment
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  # extract 10 most frequent pos/neg words
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>%
  # prep data for sorting each word independently by facet
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, sentiment)) %>%
  # generate the bar plot
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  # used with reorder_within() to label the axis tick marks
  scale_x_reordered() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(sentiment), scales = "free_y", nrow = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Sentiment of words used in Taylor Swift Albums",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Number of occurences in all eight albums (working on the rest!!)"
  ) +
  coord_flip()
ggsave(path = "img/", "ts_sentiment.png") 


## for each album
ts_pos_neg_album <- ts_bing %>%
  # generate frequency count for each album, word, and sentiment
  group_by(Album, sentiment) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  # extract 10 most frequent pos/neg words per album
  group_by(Album, sentiment) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10)

## positive words

### 4. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXAMPLE USING AFINN DICTIONARY #####

# Generate data frame with sentiment derived from the AFINN dictionary
(ts_afinn <- ts_words %>%
    inner_join(get_sentiments(lexicon = "afinn")) %>%
    group_by(Album, song))

# for further practice (at home): 
# repeat (and adapt) the code above, using the AFINN dictionary instead
# the code below shows some additional analyses you can perform (with any dictionary)


# Visualize which words in the AFINN sentiment dictionary appear most frequently


set.seed(123) # ensure reproducibility of the wordcloud
ts_afinn %>%
  # count word frequency 
  ungroup() %>%
  count(word) %>%
  # keep only top 200 words for wordcloud
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 200) %>%
  mutate(angle = 90 * sample(c(0, 1), n(), replace = TRUE, prob = c(70, 30))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(label = word, size = n, angle = angle)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud(rm_outside = TRUE) +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 10) +
  ggtitle("Most frequent 200 tokens in Taylor Swift Lyrics") +
  theme_minimal()

# Visualize positive/negative sentiment using BING dictionary
ts_words %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  reshape2::acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  comparison.cloud(colors = c( "gray70", "gray20"),
                   max.words = 100) +
  ggtitle("Most frequent Positive (dark gray) and Negative (light gray) tokens in Taylor Swift Lyrics") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave(path = "img/", "ts_wordcloud_pos_neg.png") 


# Visualize positive/negative sentiment for each album using AFINN dictionary
ts_words %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
  group_by(Album, song) %>%
  summarize(value = sum(value)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = song, y = value, fill = Album)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(Album), scales = "free_x", nrow = 2) +

## Diving more into frequency:

album_words <- ts_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  # summarize count
  count(Album, word, sort = TRUE)

total_words <- album_words %>% 
  group_by(Album) %>%

total_ts_words <- left_join(album_words, total_words)
freq_by_rank <- total_ts_words %>% 
  group_by(Album) %>%  
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total) %>%
  ungroup()

# This is interesting in that we can see that for some albums (Red & 1989)
# The top words are used much much more often
freq_by_rank %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = Album)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1, alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()


album_tf_idf <- album_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, Album, n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))


album_tf_idf %>%
  group_by(Album) %>%
  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 15) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(tf_idf, fct_reorder(word, tf_idf), fill = Album)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Album, ncol = 5, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "tf-idf", y = NULL)
ggsave(path = "img/", "ts_idf_words.png", width = 8)


## GETTING CRAZY! BIGRAMS!
ts_bigrams <- taylor_swift_lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, Lyrics, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  filter(!is.na(bigram))

bigrams_separated <- ts_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# new bigram counts:
bigram_counts <- bigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

bigram_counts


bigrams_filtered %>%
  filter(word2 != word1) %>%
  count(Album, word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

# Note: not sure how much I'll use the above since these are songs, 
# but I plan to revisit this if/when I break the albums into eras!
